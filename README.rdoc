Here is the server config scripts I used to setup the Amazon EC2 instance.
These tests were run on a Medium-sized, High CPU Instance of EC2 running a bare bones
Ubuntu 8.10 install: ami-0372946a

You can copy the "EC2 Instance Config" section into a script and run it right on the server
to get everything set up.

= Test Procedure

After all packages were install and various servers were started and found to work
the instance was rebooted to start fresh. Apache and nginx were stopped:
  /etc/init.d/nginx stop
  /etc/init.d/apache2 stop

When switching to a new framework/server a test was run once to make sure everything
was loaded into memory before recording any results.

The following script was run with slight variations for each server type. It rans each test 
11 times (the first was discarded to make sure everything was loaded into memory and ready 
to go at full speed). Only the requests per second number for each test was returned to the 
command line:

  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per' && \
  ab -n 10000 -c 50 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/ | grep 'Requests per'

== Servers
Each server was the only one running at the time of the tests. Two ssh sessions
were running. One to start the server and the other to run Apache Bench.

=== Rack
  ruby /mnt/performace/rack/erb.rb
  ab -n 1000 -c 10 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/

=== Sinatra

  thin start -c /mnt/performance/rails -e production -p 3000
  ab -n 1000 -c 10 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/go/erb

=== Rails (served by Passenger)
  /etc/init.d/apache2 start
  ab -n 1000 -c 10 -q http://127.0.0.1:3000/go/erb

  ab -n 1000 -c 10 -q http://127.0.0.1/


= My setup at time of test


My local desktop was rebooted as well and only Terminal, TextMate and Numbers
were opened so that the tests could be run and results recorded.
